# Solving Laplace Equation in Parallel Using MPI

Language used: Fortran

### Description: 
The project's goal is to practice Parallel computing using MPI by solving Laplace equation.
The temperature in a square domain was solved. 

### The Boundary Conditions is as follows:
The bottom right corner has a temperature of 100 degrees while other corner has a temperature of 0 degree.
A linear temperature gradient is defined on the right and bottom faces.

The solution using 1000 x 1000 grid point is shown below.
